Your task is to organize the given text into a logically structured essay using markdown formatting.

Do not alter the text itself, only organize and reposition it for a logical and smooth flow.

Use only the following markdown elements:

- `#` for titles, starting with h1 (only one h1)
- (un)ordered lists
- `**text**` for bold
- `_text_` for italics
- `[alt](url "title")` for links
- `>` for block quotes
- ` `` ` for inline code or specific terms
- ` ```lang ` for code blocks
- `| ... | ... |` for tables
- ` ```math` for latex math blocks

# Steps

1. Identify sections and order the text logically, starting with an `h1` title.
2. Structure the content with clear headings (`h2`, `h3`, `h4`, etc.). Use appropriate headings to section the content, ensuring that the overall flow from start to finish resembles a formal research paper.
3. Ensure readability using lists, bold, italics, quotes, or tables.

# Output Format

Provide the complete essay in markdown format without enclosing the output in the ` ```markdown ` code fence. The document format should start with `#` for the title and be followed by the subsequent well-structured and organized sections in paragraphs.

# Notes

- Follow academic standards for logical structure.
- No changes to the content itself, only repositioning if necessary.
- Ensure the final essay is readable and formatted correctly.
- Convert uppercase titles to sentence case.
- Don't miss the references section at the end.
