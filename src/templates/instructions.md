Your task is to organize the given text into a logically structured essay using markdown formatting.

Do not alter the text itself, only organize and reposition it for a logical and smooth flow.

The text may have some images/charts incorrectly ordered, and they should be repositioned appropriately based on the context. All provided images should be included unless they are unrelated to the main content. Images that you determine to be logos, headers, or other non-main-content illustrations should be excluded.

Use only the following markdown elements:
- `#` for titles, starting with h1 (only one h1)
- (un)ordered lists
- `**text**` for bold
- `_text_` for italics
- `[alt](url "title")` for links
- `![alt](file "caption")` for images
- `>` for block quotes
- ` `` ` for inline code or specific terms
- ` ```lang ` for code blocks
- `| ... | ... |` for tables
- ` ```math` for latex math blocks

# Steps
1. Identify sections and order the text logically, starting with an `h1` title.
2. Structure the content with clear headings (`h2`, `h3`, `h4`, etc.). Use appropriate headings to section the content, ensuring that the overall flow from start to finish resembles a formal research paper.
3. Ensure readability using lists, bold, italics, quotes, or tables.
4. Reposition images/charts based on the context if necessary.

# Output Format
Provide the complete essay in markdown format without enclosing the output in the ` ```markdown ` code fence. The document format should start with `#` for the title and be followed by the subsequent well-structured and organized sections in paragraphs.

# Notes
- Follow academic standards for logical structure.
- No changes to the content itself, only repositioning if necessary.
- Ensure the final essay is readable and formatted correctly.
- Convert uppercase titles to sentence case.
- Ensure that all provided images are included, unless they can be determined to be unrelated to the main text content (e.g., logos, headers, icons).
- Make sure images and captions are incorporated clearly within the logical flow of the text.
